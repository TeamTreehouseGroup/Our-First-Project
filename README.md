Our-First-Project
=================

Our first project as a team.

This is where we are going to put project ideas for now. Simply add them to the list.

Project Ideas:
==============
  1. Group Site - <a href="http://teamtreehousegroup.github.io/Our-First-Project/index.html">Preview.</a>

  2. Recreate another popular website (At least the front end of it)
  
  3. Create a Web Design Company website to promote services, etc...
  
  4. We could maybe do something like a Wine Vinyard. We'd be able to cincorporate a great deal of content as well as be able to put in a pretty small e-commerce portion of it.
	A. Maybe a section for tours of the grounds.
	B. An events listing page for wine tastings, or group events, etc...
	C. A page to buy a few of the different wines.


Individual Strengths:
==============
This is to get a feel for what each of us can do well already so far.

Paul - HTML5, CSS3, and Responsive Design are what I've been working with mostly. I know very basic PHP and am getting started in Javascript in the next few days or so. I'm currently coding CSS using Sass for my preprocessor. (Look into the Sass courses if you're unfamiliar. It makes CSS much more awesome!)

Ricky - HTML, CSS, Python for scripts, Django, and Gui development. A knowledge of the basics of PHP. I am going to try to gain an advanced Knowledge of Python, and PHP in the future.

Andre - Mainly JavaScript and jQuery, with some knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Design Ideas (Colors, Layouts, Special Touches):
============

Ricky - Drop Down nav bar with header at top of page. Then two column layout below. The left column about 70-80% of page and right column 20-30%. A footer with contact information at the bottom.

Markus - I wanted to make a little voting type system here for some options we could use. Before I start designing we should choose few things.

Paul - If at all possible, I'd like to steer away from a full Parallax page, as that seems to be rather common these days. I'd be fine with a few designs techinques that fit Parallax here and there, just not a full site of it.

###Color theme

| Options      | Steve | Paul | Ricky | Andre | Chandan | Markus |
| :----------- | :---: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :-----: | :----: |
| Dark Theme   |       | X    |       |       |         |        |
| Bright Theme |       |      |       |       |         | X      |

####If you have specific color theme in mind, please share it under

Paul - I have Dark as my choice, but it's a little broad. I'd just want to try and stay away from anything on a color wheel that is brighter than anything set to a 75% brightness. (If that makes sense at all!) Also found a nice little pleasant color pallette. :) <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/Vintage-Ralph-Lauren-color-theme-2216979/">Darker, more earthly colors</a>


###Width of the page

| Options        | Steve | Paul | Ricky | Andre | Chandan | Markus |
| :------------- | :---: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :-----: | :----: |
| Full width     |       | X    |       |       |         |        |
| Typical width  |       |      |       |       |         |        |
| Something else |       |      |       |       |         | X      |

####If something else, leave your recommendation under
 
Markus - I would like to build something completely different from normal website. Something that you won't see every day on the web.
I'm not sure what it would be, but definitely something not so mainstream. We should stand out from everyone else.

Paul - I'm not quite sure what we can pull off in terms of anything outside the box of normal width pages. There are sites that using very interesting scroll techniques, but I'm not sure we want something overly complicated for a first project.


###Flat/skeumorphic designing

| Options     | Steve | Paul | Ricky | Andre | Chandan | Markus |
| :---------- | :---: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :-----: | :----: |
| Flat        |       | X    |       |       |         | X      |
| Skeumorphic |       |      |       |       |         |        |

!!NOTES:

Markus - I'm also totally fine with more skeumorphic look, but I'd like to make our website to look modern and up to date.

Paul - I think a flat design would simply be easier to make for now. There is just a lot less to take into consideration when designing in such a way. It also seems to make file sizes smaller. (Think about the lack of box-shadow and fewer hover animations that are a little too intricate)
