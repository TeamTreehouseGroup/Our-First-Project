Our-First-Project
=================

Our first project as a team.

This is where we are going to put project ideas for now. Simply add them to the list.

Project Ideas:
==============
  1. Group Site
  2. Recreate another popular website (At least the front end of it)
  3. Create a Web Design Company website to promote services, etc...


Individual Strengths:
==============
This is to get a feel for what each of us can do well already so far.

Paul - HTML5, CSS3, and Responsive Design are what I've been working with mostly. I know very basic PHP and am getting started in Javascript in the next few days or so.
