Our-First-Project
=================

Our first project as a team.

This is where we are going to put project ideas for now. Simply add them to the list.

Project Ideas:
==============
  1. Group Site - <a href="http://teamtreehousegroup.github.io/Our-First-Project/index.html">Preview.</a>
  2. Recreate another popular website (At least the front end of it)
  3. Create a Web Design Company website to promote services, etc...


Individual Strengths:
==============
This is to get a feel for what each of us can do well already so far.

Paul - HTML5, CSS3, and Responsive Design are what I've been working with mostly. I know very basic PHP and am getting started in Javascript in the next few days or so. I'm currently coding CSS using Sass for my preprocessor. (Look into the Sass courses if you're unfamiliar. It makes CSS much more awesome!)

Ricky - HTML, CSS, Python for scripts, Django, and Gui development. A knowledge of the basics of PHP. I am going to try to gain an advanced Knowledge of Python, and PHP in the future.

Andre - Mainly JavaScript and jQuery, with some knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Design Ideas (Include, Colors, Layouts, Special Touches):
=========================================================

Ricky - Drop Down nav bar with header at top of page. Then two column layout below. The left column about 70-80% of page and right column 20-30%. A footer with contact information at the bottom.
